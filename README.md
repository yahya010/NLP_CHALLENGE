# NLP Sentiment Analysis Challenge

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the Sentiment Analysis challenge on the IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews. The objective is to apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to accurately determine the sentiment of movie reviews.

## Classifiers
In this project, we explore the effectiveness of various machine learning models for NLP tasks. The classifiers include:
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- TF-IDF Vectorization as a feature extraction method
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) as a state-of-the-art language model

## Dataset
The dataset used in this challenge consists of 50,000 movie reviews from the [IMDB database](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews). Each review is labeled as positive or negative, providing a binary classification target for sentiment analysis.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Directory containing the IMDB dataset and any additional data files used in the analyses.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with detailed analyses and model training steps.
- `models/`: Serialized versions of the trained models ready for inference.
- `reports/`: Generated reports and visualizations that summarize the findings and model performances.

## Results
The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure a comprehensive understanding of their performance. Detailed results and discussions are presented within the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
